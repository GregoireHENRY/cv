Dimorphos is the moon of a binary asteroid system. It is orbiting around a
bigger asteroid called Didymos. They are classified as potential hazardous
asteroids and near-Earth objects. In order to prepare the defense of the Earth
in the case of a direct impact of an asteroid, the Hera mission will initiate in
the years to follow an impact onto Dimorphos. The NASA is in charge of the
collision with the asteroid. The ESA will study the outcomes of the impact. The
spacecraft Hera will be equipped of infrared sensors, such as uncooled
bolometers. Studying the evolution of the temperature on Dimorphos will help us
understanding what happen after a collision. This work fits into the scheme of
the simulations of thermal camera images from the spacecraft around the
asteroid. This paper shows a method using asteroid thermophysical model, 3D
numerical solver, NASA/NAIF SPICE and shape models.
