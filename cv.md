          Development of
          \mhref{kalast}{https://gitlab-as.oma.be/gregoireh/kalast}
          on Rust, a new tool to compute the temperature at the surface of
          asteroids. The code support the thermophysics involved for binary
          system of asteroids.

          Implementation of
          \mhref{spice-rust}{https://github.com/GregoireHENRY/rust-spice},
          the library to use Spice library in idiomatic Rust.

          Embedded software development for the gravimeter GRASS.

          Code review, architecture support and implementation of user interfaces
          for multiple projects (Matlab, Python).

aboutme: |
  A fan of space coding simulations in his bedroom all day long. I dream of
  space and travels. I would love to start a Ph.D abroad in astrophysics,
  planetology, galaxy formation, ... My goal for the future is to work for an
  Observatory in Chile, Hawaii or New-Zealand. I have a post-it note to
  remember there is a life outside programming, so I play piano, read books, do
  sports, and try amap to teach younger fellows.
