          Development of
          \href{https://gitlab-as.oma.be/gregoireh/kalast}{\uline{kalast}}
          on Rust, a new tool to compute the temperature at the surface of
          asteroids. The code support the thermophysics involved for binary
          system of asteroids.

          Implementation of
          \href{https://github.com/GregoireHENRY/rust-spice}{\muline{spice-rust}},
          the library to use Spice on Rust.

          Embedded software development for the gravimeter GRASS.

          Code review, architecture support and implementation of user interfaces
          for multiple projects (Matlab, Python).

aboutme: |
  A fan of space coding simulations in his bedroom all day long. I dream of
  space and travels. I would love to start a Ph.D abroad in astrophysics,
  planetology, galaxy formation, ... My goal for the future is to work for an
  Observatory in Chile, Hawaii or New-Zealand. I have a post-it note to
  remember there is a life outside programming, so I play piano, read books, do
  sports, and try amap to teach younger fellows.
